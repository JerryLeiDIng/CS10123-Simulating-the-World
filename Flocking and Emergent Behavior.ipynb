It would be incredibly difficult to invidually simulate the motivations of each agent (plus, it would require algorithmic knowledge beyond the scope of this two-hour course). We want a simple system that can handle a lot of agents, but still captures the essential qualities of the system. It turns out that this isn't as hard as it sounds! We can abstract away a lot of the complexity behind what drives real organisms and still obtain the same emergent properties when we lump a lot of them together.\n",
